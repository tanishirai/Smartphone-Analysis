# Smartphone Data Analysis Project

## Overview  
This project delivers an in-depth analysis of smartphone specifications and market trends using a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary goal is to uncover insights related to pricing, performance, battery life, camera capabilities, and display features, helping consumers, manufacturers, and market analysts better understand the smartphone industry landscape in India.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project includes detailed, clean, and preprocessed information with 26 columns covering various smartphone specifications:  
- Pricing & Ratings: Price (INR), User Ratings  
- Hardware & Performance: Processor Brand, Speed, Core Count, RAM, Storage (Internal & Expandable)  
- Battery & Display: Battery Capacity (mAh), Fast Charging Support, Screen Size, Refresh Rate, Screen Resolution  
- Camera: Rear and Front Camera Megapixels  
- Connectivity: 5G, NFC, IR Blaster  
- Software: Operating System

## Key Objectives  
- Analyze how features like processor type, RAM size, and camera specifications influence smartphone pricing.  
- Identify phones offering value within budget segments (e.g., under ₹15,000) with modern features like 5G and fast charging.  
- Explore battery performance and charging capabilities across price segments.  
- Examine camera quality trends across budget, mid-range, and premium smartphones.  
- Understand popular display sizes, resolutions, and refresh rate distributions among 5G-enabled devices.

## Analytical Highlights  

### Pricing and Ratings  
- Higher RAM and premium processors (Apple Bionic, Snapdragon) correlate with higher prices.  
- Brands like Samsung, Oppo, and Motorola offer a wide range of affordable options under ₹20,000.  
- Smartphones with better ratings generally come with more internal memory and advanced features.

### Battery and Performance  
- Premium phones have the largest batteries; however, mid-range and budget phones are closing the gap with 6,000mAh+ capacities.  
- Rugged phone manufacturers like Doogee and Oukitel lead in battery capacity and fast charging availability.

### Camera Analysis  
- Budget devices from brands such as Vivo and Infinix offer front cameras exceeding 32MP resolution.  
- Rear camera megapixels are significantly higher in premium phones, with brands like Honor and Motorola offering up to 200MP cameras.

### Display and Connectivity  
- Most 5G phones feature screen sizes between 6 and 6.5 inches.  
- The most common screen resolution in budget phones is 720x1600.  
- Phones supporting 120Hz refresh rates tend to be priced above ₹40,000, mainly flagship models from Apple and others.

## Consumer Recommendations  
- Power users should consider phones with larger RAM and premium processors for optimal performance.  
- Battery-conscious buyers should prioritize devices offering 6,000mAh+ capacity and fast charging.  
- Photography enthusiasts will benefit from premium and mid-range phones with high-resolution rear and front cameras.

## SQL Queries Included  
The project incorporates various SQL queries to extract insights such as:  
- Average price by processor brand and RAM size  
- Top 5G phones under ₹15,000  
- Distribution of processor core counts across models  
- Battery capacity ranking by price segment  
- Camera megapixel analysis by price segment  
- Display size and resolution popularity in 5G phones  

## Tools and Techniques  
- Data analysis using SQL for querying and aggregations.  
- Power BI for visualization and trend analysis.  

## Project Usage  
This project can guide smartphone buyers, manufacturers, and analysts to make data-driven decisions by understanding feature-price relationships and market trends in the competitive smartphone landscape.
